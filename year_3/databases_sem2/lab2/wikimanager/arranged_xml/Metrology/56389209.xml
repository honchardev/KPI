<page><title>Flick (time)</title><pageid>56389209</pageid><category>Metrology</category><sections><section title="">A flick is a unit of time equivalent to exactly 1/705,600,000 of a second. The figure was chosen so that frequencies of 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, 60, 90, 100 and 120 Hz, as well as 1/1000 divisions of all those, can be represented with integers. The unit was launched in January 2018 by Facebook. A flick is approximately 1.42 &#215; 10&#8722;9 s, which makes it larger than a nanosecond but much smaller than a microsecond.
A similar unit for integer representation of temporal points was proposed in 2004 under the name TimeRef, splitting a second into 14,112,000 parts. This makes 1 TimeRef equivalent to 50 Flicks.


</section><section title="Etymology">The word flick is a portmanteau of frame (as in e.g. animation frame) and tick (as in computer instruction cycle).
