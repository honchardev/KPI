This makes it possible for multiple users on multiple machines to share files and storage resources.
Distributed file systems differ in their performance, mutability of content, handling of concurrent writes, handling of permanent or temporary loss of nodes or storage, and their policy of storing content.

</section><section title="Comparison">Some researchers have made a functional and experimental analysis of several distributed file systems including HDFS, Ceph, Gluster, Lustre and old (1.6.x) version of MooseFS, although this document is over 4 years old and a lot of information may be outdated (e.g. MooseFS has at the time of writing this stable 2.0 and beta 3.0 version and HA for Metadata Server - since 2.0 and it is not mentioned in this document).
The cloud based remote distributed storage from major vendors have different APIs and different consistency models.
