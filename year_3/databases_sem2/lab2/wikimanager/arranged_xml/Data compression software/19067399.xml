It compares their disk image handling features.


</section><section title="Comparison criteria">This article compares two features: Supported file formats and capabilities of the software as to how they treat the image format.


=== Capabilities ===
"Creates?"
Specifies whether the application can create a new disc image file, either by capturing the image of an actual disc, by composing a disc image file from locally stored files or an empty disc image.
"Modifies?"
Specifies whether the application is able to manipulate the contents of an existing disc image file, including adding, changing or deleting files within or modifying disc image metadata.
"Mounts?"
Specifies whether the application can emulate an optical disc drive. Such an application treats a disc image file like a virtual disc and virtually inserts it into that emulated virtual drive.
"Restores?"
Specifies whether the application can write the contents of a disk image file onto a physical media (such as an optical disc, a floppy disk, a hard disk drive or a USB flash drive) and create a physical replica.
"Extracts?"
Specifies whether the application can copy some or all of the files within a disc image file to somewhere else.


=== Supported file formats ===
"Input"
Specifies the types of disc image formats that the application can open.
"Output"
Specifies the types of disc image formats that the application can save to.
