Per IEC 62304:2006, software can be divided into three separate classes:
Class A: No injury or damage to health is possible
Class B: Nonserious injury is possible
Class C: Death or serious injury is possible


=== Serious injury ===
Injury or illness that directly or indirectly
is life threatening
results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or
necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.
