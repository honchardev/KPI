=== Origins ===
Multiven was founded in 2005 in Palo Alto California by Peter Alfred-Adekeye. His aim was to build a company able to maintain the integrity of the world's Internet infrastructure without a hardware, software or political agenda. Multiven's core mission is to provide owners and operators of Internet networks with a single, independent end-to-end network maintenance, management and cyber-defence services.
Headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Multiven is today the world's first and only independent provider of software management, maintenance and cyber-defence services for Internet networks. Multiven has regional sales offices in Paris, France, London, UK, Dubai, UAE.


=== History of Market ===
The Internet, a short form of the word Internetwork, is an international ubiquitous network of networks. Given the amount of data traversing it, its criticality to personal, corporate and national security cannot be over-emphasized.
The Internet infrastructure comprises software-driven networked switches, routers, firewalls, servers and storage hardware that switch, route, protect and store all voice, video and text data intelligently across the world.
Internet equipment manufacturers like Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, etc.. have a quasi monopoly on the multi-Billion dollar software maintenance services market for networking equipment through their own maintenance contracts and authorized third party maintenance. Multiven is the only provider offering a one-stop alternative for businesses of all sizes.


=== The Multiven Open Marketplace ===
In March 2018, Multiven launched the development of the Multiven Open Marketplace, a blockchain project aiming to transition its existing business into a decentralized organisation; Multiven is developing a blockchain-based open Marketplace to allow customers to buy and sell IT hardware, software and services, without intermediaries, solely powered by small contracts. Multiven's maintenance and cybersecurity services will be accessible on the platform and can be bound to any hardware device.


</section><section title="Services">Multiven proposes different ranges of services depending on the need of their customers.
Multiven handles software asset management through a free cloud-based application that simplifies the way organizations inventory and manage all their IT and network hardware and software assets. The company provides software maintenance by using features that include 24x7 direct-to-expert support, proactive solutions, AI-enabled knowledge-engine and lifetime software support. It can be deployed on a monthly, quarterly, bi-annual or annual basis for a customers' entire network install-base.
One of the most important service is network-based cyberdefense, a service that guarantees to stop cyber-attacks within a network and restore service within 24 hours of an attack. The service is neutral, impartial and independent with no allegiance to any nation state. It focuses on eliminating Advanced Persistent Threats, which are the most intrusive and pervasive form of cyberattacks. It is powered by an elite team of 1000+ network and security experts in 55 countries, called Pingsta.
Software recycling is a service conducted through an online platform that provides owners of pre-owned Cisco software licenses with the unprecedented ability to recycle their unwanted Cisco software and resell it. Currently, only Cisco software licenses within the European Economic Area (i.e. the EU 28 nation states, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) can be resold in the Multiven Marketplace. Buyers can come from anywhere in the world.
These services will gradually be transitioned to Multiven's blockchain initiative.

=== Antitrust lawsuit against Cisco Systems ===
On December 1, 2008, Multiven filed an antitrust lawsuit[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] against Cisco Systems, Inc. in an effort to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven&#8217;s complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (&#8220;SMARTnet&#8221;) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco&#8217;s alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment.[10]


=== CEO criminal charges ===
Cisco in turn accused Multiven CEO Peter Alfred-Adekeye of illegal access to Cisco material using a Cisco ID. Alfred-Adekeye is a naturalised British citizen, a resident of Zurich, and a former Cisco employee. After several months in which US authorities prevented his entry into the country for participation in the litigation, a special hearing in the case took place at a Canadian hotel on 20 May 2010, involving a US special master and four Cisco lawyers. He was arrested from the court session by Canadian police based on a misleading US arrest warrant.
Alfred-Adekeye was released after 28 days in custody but was forced to remain in Canada for another year before he was allowed to return to Zurich. In June 2011, a Canadian judge stayed the extradition, ruling that the strict standard of "extraordinary misconduct" was met by the circumstances and speaking of the "audacity of it all", of "Cisco's duplicity", and the "shocking" act of preventing someone's participation in a judicial proceeding by arresting them to supposedly force them to participate. False material in the US attorney's letter had misled the judge who signed the Canadian arrest warrant. "Grotesquely inflated" charges and the unjustified portrayal of Alfred-Adekeye as a Nigerian-born scam artist and flight risk had misled the Canadian judicial system further. The underlying civil case by Multiven against Cisco had been withheld from them.


=== After the Lawsuit ===
Since the Cisco case, Peter Adekeye says, Multiven has recruited almost 1200 engineers to offer businesses various levels of assistance.[13]
The company operates a free web application which provides key information about a range of network equipment. The site highlights devices and support issues that are &#8216;trending&#8217; &#8211; i.e. seeing a spike in support tickets &#8211; allowing users to address issues proactively.
Adekeye says the company has made a &#8220;humble" but "growing&#8221; foothold of customers in the US, and is starting to expand in Europe, Africa and Middle East.
