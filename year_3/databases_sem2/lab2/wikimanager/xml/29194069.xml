Zingaya provides next generation click-to-call services. Using Adobe Flash-based Voice over Internet Protocol technology, the company provides an embedded widget that forwards an end user through a VoIP call to landlines, mobile phones, Skype accounts, or other computers &#8211; whichever the website operator has specified. There&#8217;s no download, and no phone is required for the caller. A visitor to a website simply clicks the &#8220;Call&#8221; button on the widget.
In October 2010, Zingaya debuted their Zin.to service, which gives Twitter users the ability to have specific followers call them by clicking on a link that they tweet. Like the Zingaya widget, the caller is calling through their web browser, and the call's recipient can choose where they want the call forwarded to.
