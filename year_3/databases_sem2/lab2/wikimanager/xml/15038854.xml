</section><section title="Introduction to Neurofeedback">Neurofeedback (NFB), also called neurotherapy, neurobiofeedback or EEG biofeedback (EEGBF) is a therapy technique that presents the user with real-time information about activity within their brain, as measured by electrical or blood-flow sensors on the scalp. Brain activity is monitored and processed to provide feedback to the user in one of several ways, for example a video game rocket ship might accelerate when desired brainwaves are produced (positive feedback), or a film or music might pause when undesired brainwaves are produced (negative feedback).
The user then uses this feedback to develop the brainwaves they wish to create and as a consequence, learn to gain more control over their brainwaves and therefore how they think and feel in every day situations. It has been used to help a range of conditions including ADHD and addictions.
