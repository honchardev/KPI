</section><section title="Java">
Java has strong IDE support, due not only to its historical and economic importance, but also due to a combination of reflection and static-typing making it well-suited for IDE support. Some of the leading Java IDEs (such as IntelliJ and Eclipse) are also the basis for leading IDEs in other programming languages (e.g. for Python, IntelliJ is rebranded as PyCharm, and Eclipse has the PyDev plugin.)
