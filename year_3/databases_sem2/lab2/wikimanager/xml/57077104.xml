</section><section title="History">Flatiron School was founded in 2012 by Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum. It received two rounds of funding in 2014 and 2015.
In 2017, the New York State Attorney fined Flatiron $375,000 after it was found to be operating without a licence and making misleading statements about the employment status and earning potential of graduates. They claimed a 98.5% employment rate but this included apprentices and freelance workers, while the claimed average salary of $74,447 only included graduates in full time employment.


=== Acquisition by WeWork ===
Flatiron School was acquired by WeWork, a collaborative workspace company, in October 2017.
