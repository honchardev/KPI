The Standing Liberty quarter was a 25-cent coin struck by the United States Mint from 1916 to 1930. It succeeded the Barber quarter, which had been minted since 1892. Featuring the goddess of Liberty on one side and an eagle in flight on the other, the coin was designed by sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil. In 1915, he submitted a design that showed Liberty on guard against attacks. The Mint required modifications, and his revised version included dolphins to represent the oceans. In late 1916, Mint officials made major changes, but MacNeil was allowed to create a new design, which included a chain mail vest covering Liberty's formerly bare breast. In circulation, the coin's date wore away quickly, and Mint engravers modified the design to address the issue in 1925. The Standing Liberty quarter was discontinued in 1931, a year in which no quarters were struck. The Washington quarter was introduced the next year to celebrate the bicentennial of George Washington's birth. (Full article...) asdf as;dklf aklsdjfasd;ljf l;asdjf;l as
